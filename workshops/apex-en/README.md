## Oracle Application Express: Developing Database Web Applications
## Hands-On-Labs Guide

This series of hands-on labs are part of the course material **Oracle Application Express: Developing Database Web Applications**. The labs are designed to teach you how to build applications using Oracle Application Express. The primary vehicle for teaching is a single use case which is expanded on with each lab.

## Prerequisites

The steps and screenshots in this hands-on-labs use Oracle Application Express 5.1.

To run these hands-on-labs, you need to:

-   Obtain an Oracle Application Express Workspace and a Workspace Administrator /Developer user account. Select the most appropriate option from those listed below to obtain a Workspace:

    -   [apex.oracle.com](http://apex.oracle.com/) - Request a workspace on Oracle's free 'development only' service for evaluating the technology.

    -   [Oracle Database Cloud Service](https://cloud.oracle.com/database) - Request service on the Oracle Database Cloud Service. Once provisioned you will be provided access to your cloud service which includes an Oracle Application Express Workspace.

    -   [Oracle Database 11g Express Edition](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/products/express-edition/overview/index.html) - Download Oracle XE and install on your laptop or desktop machine and then [download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/apex/downloads/index.html) and install the latest Oracle Application Express release.

    -   [Oracle VM Virtual Box](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/databaseappdev-vm-161299.html) - Download Oracle VM Virtual Box and then import the [Database Application Development Appliance](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/databaseappdev-vm-161299.html) which includes Oracle Database 12c, Application Express and a number of labs pre-installed.

-   Download the lab source files from [GitHub Page](https://github.com/ckoratam/OracleAPEX-Curriculum). Alternatively, download the **apex-curriculum-3681867.zip** file from [https://apex.oracle.com/education](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/apex/learnmore/apex-education-2517914.html) and then extract the **apex-curriculum-labs** folder into your working directory. The apex-curriculum-3681867.zip file also includes the apex-curriculum-ppts folder. This folder contains the slide decks for all of the lessons in this course material. Note that the slide decks for the lessons are not hosted on this GitHub page.
